# Resume


This is just a repository for my resume file, written in LaTeX. I opted to migrate it to its own repo because every time I wanted to
update my resume, I had to rebuild my personal portfolio website. In order to reduce the frequency of rebuilds
I instead opted to host it on its own Github page. Feel free to [download it](https://github.com/xNS5/resume/blob/gh-pages/MichaelKennedy_Resume.pdf) or go to https://www.michaelkennedy.dev/resume.
