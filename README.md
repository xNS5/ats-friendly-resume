# Resume


This is just a repository for my resume file, written in LaTeX. I opted to migrate it to its own repo because every time I wanted to
update my resume, I had to rebuild [my personal website](https://www.michaelkennedy.dev). In order to reduce the frequency of rebuilds
I instead opted to host it on its own Github page. Feel free to [download it]([MichaelKennedy_Resume.pdf](https://github.com/xNS5/resume/blob/gh-pages/MichaelKennedy_Resume.pdf)https://github.com/xNS5/resume/blob/gh-pages/MichaelKennedy_Resume.pdf) or go to https://www.michaelkennedy.dev/resume.
